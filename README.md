# NEXTJS BLOG PROJECT


In this project, I tried to make a fullstack blog website. People can sign in, sign up to project and all informations keep in database, also password of user keeps crypt. People can search posts by any text of post and its tag on two pages which are on home page and search page. People can add a new post, like posts and comment on a post, also they can edit and delete their posts. People have a profile page,they can update their informations and add a new profile image. Home page has a part that show most popular posts.
